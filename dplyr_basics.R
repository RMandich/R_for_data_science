#Filter shows a subset of the data based on your restrictions
filter(data = flights, month == 1, day == 1)

filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)

#Find all flights that:

#Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)

filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))

#Were operated by United, American, or Delta
filter(flights, carrier %in% c('UA', 'AA', 'DL'))

#Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
filter(flights, month %in% c(7, 8, 9))

#Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)

#Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

#Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
filter(flights, between(dep_time, 0000, 0600)) 

#How many flights have a missing dep_time?

#arrange() works similarly to filter() except that instead
#of selecting rows, it changes their order.

arrange(flights, year, month, day)

arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_delay)))



#select() is used to filter variables you are interested in

#rename is pretty obvious
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)

#mutate add new columns that are functions of other colunms
#first We create a new smaller dataset

#Then we can add new calculated columns to it, using mutate

#Summarise is used to collapse a data frame into a single row, 
#containing a statistical expression. When combined with group by
#we can make statistical aggregations of variables, like this:

summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

#The na.rm argument is used to remove NA values

by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))


#The 'pipe' operator (%>%) is very useful to perform multiple
#transformations with data in the same expression. A good way
#to think about the pipe is to read it as "Then"

#This code attributes the data frame to a variable, THEN it groups
#by destination, THEN it summarises some measures and THEN it applies
#filter to remove unwanted data.
